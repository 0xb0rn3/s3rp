# 🐍 s3rp (Serpent) | Red Team Tactical Manual

**Author:** oxbv1 | 0xb0rn3  
**AI Collaboration:** This toolkit was developed in cooperation with Google Gemini. The AI assisted with code refinement, syntax optimization, and structural organization, but the tactical methodology and red team approach are rooted in real-world penetration testing experience.

## What You're Looking At

This isn't just a collection of bash scripts. What you're seeing is my evolution as a developer and penetration tester, captured in code. From scan01 to scan09, you're watching me learn in real-time—from basic reconnaissance to full-scale automated exploitation frameworks.

I want to be transparent: I built this with Google Gemini's help. The AI cleaned up syntax, optimized logic, and structured the code. But it didn't decide tactical approaches, evasion techniques, or which flags matter in the field. That came from real experience dodging IDS systems and understanding how blue teams think.

## The Learning Path

### Phase One: Building the Foundation (scan01-03)

**What you're learning:** The basics of wrapping nmap in a user-friendly interface.

**scan01** is your starting point. It's a menu-driven wrapper that eliminates the need to memorize nmap flags. Look at the `grep -v "Starting Nmap"` filter—that's not aesthetic, it's practical. When you're managing multiple scans, noise becomes a serious problem.

**scan02** introduced tactical configurations with aggressive visual presentation. The color scheme changes aren't just for looks—when you're running multiple terminals during an engagement, visual differentiation is operational necessity.

**scan03** added dependency management and auto-installation. In the field, discovering you're missing a tool mid-scan is unacceptable. The script handles it or fails gracefully with clear instructions.

**Key modifications to try:**
- Change grep filters to match your noise tolerance
- Modify color schemes for your terminal setup
- Adjust the dependency list for your toolkit
- Customize output directory structures

### Phase Two: Learning to Be Invisible (scan04-06)

**What you're learning:** Evasion techniques and operational security.

**scan04** introduced packet fragmentation (`-f`), MTU manipulation (`--mtu 8`), source port spoofing (`-g 53`), and decoy IPs (`-D RND:10`). Each flag serves a specific evasion purpose:

- **Fragmentation (`-f`)**: Breaks packets into pieces that many IDS systems can't reassemble
- **MTU manipulation (`--mtu 8`)**: Sets extremely small packet sizes for deeper evasion
- **Source port 53 (`-g 53`)**: Mimics DNS traffic to bypass firewall rules
- **Decoys (`-D RND:10`)**: Creates phantom scanners to hide your real IP

**scan05** integrated ProxyChains for IP anonymization and added Metasploit resource file generation—automating hours of manual MSF configuration.

**scan06** refined the exploit automation with better Searchsploit integration and intelligent parsing.

**Key modifications to try:**
- Adjust decoy count (try `-D RND:3` vs `-D RND:20`)
- Experiment with MTU values (8, 16, 24)
- Test different source ports (53 for DNS, 80 for HTTP)
- Configure ProxyChains with different proxy chains

### Phase Three: Automation and Integration (scan07-09)

**What you're learning:** Chaining tools into complete workflows.

**scan07** automated web enumeration. When ports 80, 443, or 8080 are detected, Gobuster launches automatically. No manual intervention required.

**scan08** polished the integration with better error handling and cleaner output parsing.

**scan09** represents the apex—complete integration of all previous features plus refined reporting and session management.

**Key modifications to try:**
- Swap Gobuster wordlists (`/usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt`)
- Adjust thread counts (`-t 50` to `-t 100` or `-t 25`)
- Add additional web ports to scan (8000, 8888, 9090)
- Customize the MSF resource file templates

---

## Building Your Own Toolkit: The Skeleton Approach

Instead of giving you another full script, here's how to think about building your own:

### The Function Library Approach

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# My Custom Security Framework
# Built by [Your Name] using s3rp as reference

# ====================================
# CONFIGURATION SECTION
# ====================================
# Copy this from the unified framework and modify:
# - Color schemes
# - Default tool paths
# - Your preferred flags
# - Custom wordlist locations

RED='\033[1;31m'
GRN='\033[1;32m'
NC='\033[0m'

MY_DEFAULT_WORDLIST="/path/to/my/favorite/wordlist.txt"
MY_DEFAULT_TIMING="-T4"

# ====================================
# FUNCTION LIBRARY
# ====================================
# Copy functions you need from s3rp and customize them

# From scan01: Basic scanning
scan_target() {
    # Your custom implementation
    echo "Scanning $1 with my preferred settings..."
}

# From scan04: Evasion techniques  
stealth_scan() {
    # Copy the evasion logic but adjust to your needs
    local target=$1
    nmap -sS -f -g 53 -D RND:5 "$target"
}

# From scan07: Web enumeration
enumerate_web() {
    # Use your preferred web scanner
    # Maybe you prefer ffuf over gobuster?
    local url=$1
    ffuf -u "$url/FUZZ" -w "$MY_DEFAULT_WORDLIST"
}

# ====================================
# YOUR CUSTOM WORKFLOW
# ====================================
# This is where you combine functions YOUR way

my_workflow() {
    local target=$1
    
    # Your unique approach
    echo "Phase 1: Quick recon"
    scan_target "$target"
    
    echo "Phase 2: Web attack"
    enumerate_web "http://$target"
    
    echo "Phase 3: Your custom step"
    # Add whatever makes sense for YOUR engagements
}

# Run it
my_workflow "$1"
```

### What to Customize

1. **Tool Selection**
   - Replace Gobuster with ffuf, dirsearch, or feroxbuster
   - Use masscan instead of nmap for speed
   - Swap searchsploit for CVE API lookups

2. **Workflow Order**
   - Maybe you always start with masscan for speed, then detailed nmap
   - Perhaps you enumerate web first, scan second
   - Your engagement methodology should drive the flow

3. **Output Format**
   - Some people want JSON for parsing
   - Others want markdown for reporting
   - You might want database integration

4. **Notification Systems**
   - Add Slack notifications when interesting ports are found
   - Email reports automatically
   - Discord webhooks for team coordination

---

## Network Interface Detection & Selection

One of the critical features in the unified framework is **intelligent network interface management**. This is essential for:

### Why Interface Selection Matters

**Multi-homed Systems:**
When you have multiple network interfaces (e.g., ethernet + wireless), nmap needs to know which one to use. The wrong interface means your traffic goes out the wrong network, potentially:
- Exposing your real IP when you meant to use VPN
- Scanning from the wrong network segment
- Triggering alerts on an interface you didn't intend to use

**VPN Scenarios:**
If you're using a VPN (ProtonVPN, NordVPN, custom OpenVPN), you have:
- Physical interface (eth0, wlan0) - your REAL IP
- VPN interface (tun0, tap0) - your PROTECTED IP

**The framework detects both and lets you choose**, preventing accidental exposure.

**Wireless Pentesting:**
When doing wireless assessments, you might have:
- Normal wireless interface (wlan0)
- Monitor mode interface (wlan0mon)
- Multiple wireless cards for different frequencies

### How the Feature Works

When you run the unified framework, it:

1. **Scans all network interfaces** using `ip` or `ifconfig`
2. **Extracts key information:**
   - Interface name (eth0, wlan0, tun0, etc.)
   - State (UP/DOWN)
   - IP address
   - MAC address
3. **Color codes by type:**
   - 🔵 Cyan = Ethernet (eth0, ens33)
   - 🟡 Yellow = Wireless (wlan0, wlp3s0)
   - 🟢 Green = VPN/Tunnel (tun0, tap0)
4. **Presents options:**
   - [A] Auto-detect - uses default route interface
   - [M] Manual - type interface name
   - [S] Skip - let nmap decide
   - [1-N] Select from list

### Example Output

```
╔════════════════════════════════╗
║   NETWORK INTERFACE DETECTION  ║
╚════════════════════════════════╝

Available Network Interfaces:

No.  Interface       State      IP Address         MAC Address
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[1]  eth0            UP         192.168.1.100      aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
[2]  wlan0           UP         192.168.1.101      11:22:33:44:55:66
[3]  tun0            UP         10.8.0.2           No MAC

[?] Select interface for scanning:
    [A] Auto-detect (use default route)
    [M] Manual specification
    [S] Skip (let nmap decide)
Selection [1-3/A/M/S]:
```

### Real-World Usage Scenarios

**Scenario 1: VPN Pentesting**
```bash
# You're on a VPN and want to ensure anonymity
./sampleframework.sh

# When interface selection appears:
# SELECT: [3] tun0
# This ensures ALL traffic goes through VPN

# If you accidentally select [1] eth0, your REAL IP is exposed!
```

**Scenario 2: Internal Network Assessment**
```bash
# You're connected to client network via ethernet
# But also have WiFi connected to internet

# SELECT: [1] eth0 (client network)
# NOT: [2] wlan0 (wrong network entirely)
```

**Scenario 3: Testing from Multiple Perspectives**
```bash
# First scan from internal network
./sampleframework.sh
# Select: eth0

# Then scan from wireless perspective
./sampleframework.sh
# Select: wlan0

# Compare results to see network segmentation
```

**Scenario 4: Wireless Audit with Monitor Mode**
```bash
# Set interface to monitor mode first
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0

# Run framework
./sampleframework.sh

# Interface list now shows:
# [1] eth0
# [2] wlan0mon  ← Monitor mode interface
# SELECT: [2] for wireless audit
```

### Technical Implementation

The function uses modern Linux networking tools:

```bash
# Detection uses 'ip' command (preferred)
ip link show                 # Lists all interfaces
ip addr show <interface>     # Gets IP address
ip route | grep default      # Finds default route

# Falls back to 'ifconfig' if 'ip' unavailable
ifconfig -a                  # Lists interfaces (legacy)
route -n                     # Gets routes (legacy)
```

### Customization Ideas

You can extend this function to:

**1. Interface Speed Detection:**
```bash
# Add bandwidth detection
ethtool eth0 | grep Speed
# Shows: Speed: 1000Mb/s

# Automatically prefer faster interface
```

**2. VPN Verification:**
```bash
# Verify VPN is actually routing traffic
curl -s ifconfig.me          # Shows public IP
# Compare with expected VPN IP
```

**3. Wireless Signal Strength:**
```bash
# For wireless interfaces, show signal
iwconfig wlan0 | grep "Signal level"
# Help choose strongest connection
```

**4. Interface Monitoring:**
```bash
# Show live traffic on interface
watch -n 1 "ifconfig eth0 | grep 'RX packets'"
# Verify traffic is flowing
```

### Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Running Too Fast
**Problem:** `-T5` timing triggers IDS  
**Solution:** Use `-T2` or `-T3` for production networks  
**Learn:** Speed vs stealth is always a trade-off

### Pitfall 2: Too Many Decoys
**Problem:** `-D RND:50` looks suspicious  
**Solution:** Use 3-10 decoys maximum  
**Learn:** Realistic traffic patterns matter

### Pitfall 3: Wrong Wordlist
**Problem:** Using `common.txt` on a massive site  
**Solution:** Choose wordlist based on time budget  
**Learn:** `common.txt` = quick, `directory-list-2.3-medium.txt` = thorough

### Pitfall 4: Ignoring Failed Proxies
**Problem:** ProxyChains config broken, but script runs anyway  
**Solution:** The unified framework checks proxy health  
**Learn:** Always verify your anonymity layer

### Pitfall 5: Not Saving Session Data
**Problem:** Lost terminal, lost all results  
**Solution:** All scripts save to organized directories  
**Learn:** Session management is critical

### Pitfall 6: Wrong Interface Selection (NEW - CRITICAL)
**Problem:** Selected eth0 when you meant to use tun0 (VPN)  
**Result:** Your REAL IP is logged by target's IDS  
**Impact:** Client sees unauthorized IP, thinks it's an attack  
**Solution:** Framework displays IP addresses - VERIFY before proceeding  
**Learn:** Interface selection is not optional, it's operational security  

**Real incident:**
```
What happened: Pentester selected wrong interface
Timeline:
  10:00 AM - Started scan from home WiFi (wrong)
  10:15 AM - Client SOC sees scan from unknown IP
  10:20 AM - SOC escalates to CISO
  10:30 AM - CISO calls pentesting firm
  10:35 AM - Very awkward phone call
  
Lesson: ALWAYS verify interface IP before scanning
```

### Pitfall 7: Interface Failover During Scan (NEW)
**Problem:** VPN drops mid-scan, traffic fails over to physical interface  
**Result:** Scan continues from unauthorized IP  
**Solution:** Monitor interface stability, use framework's interface logging  
**Learn:** Set up VPN kill switch: `iptables -A OUTPUT ! -o tun0 -j DROP`

**Prevention:**
```bash
# Before long scans, test interface stability
ping -I tun0 8.8.8.8 -c 100

# If you see drops:
# 100 packets transmitted, 95 received, 5% packet loss
# = Interface is unstable, fix it first!
```

### Pitfall 8: Multi-Interface Confusion (NEW)
**Problem:** System has 5+ interfaces (docker, VPN, multiple NICs)  
**Result:** Selected wrong one, traffic goes unexpected route  
**Solution:** Framework color-codes and shows IPs - read carefully  
**Learn:** More interfaces = more ways to mess up

**How to verify:**
```bash
# After selecting interface in framework
# Open second terminal:
sudo tcpdump -i <selected_interface> -n

# You should see YOUR scan traffic
# If you don't see traffic = WRONG INTERFACE
```

---

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

**Pitfall 1: Selecting Wrong Interface**
```
Problem: Selected eth0, but meant to use tun0 (VPN)
Result: Real IP exposed to target
Solution: Framework shows IP addresses - verify before proceeding
```

**Pitfall 2: Interface Goes Down Mid-Scan**
```
Problem: WiFi disconnects during scan
Result: Scan fails partway through
Solution: Use ethernet for stability, or add reconnection logic
```

**Pitfall 3: No Interface Selected**
```
Problem: Hit [S]kip without thinking
Result: Nmap picks interface automatically (might be wrong one)
Solution: Framework logs selection, always verify
```

**Pitfall 4: Docker/Container Interfaces**
```
Problem: Too many virtual interfaces (docker0, veth*, etc.)
Result: Confusing interface list
Solution: Framework filters common virtual interfaces, or manual selection
```

### How to Modify for Your Needs

**Filter Out Virtual Interfaces:**
```bash
# In detect_interfaces(), add filter:
[[ "$iface" =~ ^(docker|veth|br-) ]] && continue
```

**Add Interface Testing:**
```bash
# Ping test before scanning
ping -c 1 -I $SELECTED_INTERFACE $TARGET &>/dev/null
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Interface can't reach target!"
fi
```

**Save Preferred Interface:**
```bash
# Remember last used interface
echo "$SELECTED_INTERFACE" > ~/.s3rp_interface
# Auto-load next time
```

**Multi-Interface Scanning:**
```bash
# Scan from MULTIPLE interfaces simultaneously
for iface in "${interfaces[@]}"; do
    nmap -e $iface $TARGET &
done
wait
```

### Integration with ProxyChains

When using both interface selection AND ProxyChains:

```bash
# Interface selection happens FIRST
# Then ProxyChains wraps the command

# Flow:
1. Select interface: tun0 (VPN)
2. Enable ProxyChains: Yes
3. Final command:
   proxychains4 nmap -e tun0 [target]

# This gives you:
# - VPN anonymity (tun0)
# - SOCKS proxy anonymity (proxychains)
# = Double anonymization layer
```

**⚠️ Warning:** Using both doesn't always make sense:
- VPN + ProxyChains = Possible, but check if proxies work over VPN
- Some proxy chains may not route over VPN interfaces
- Test connectivity before assuming it works

### Advanced: Interface-Specific Profiles

You can create interface-aware scan profiles:

```bash
configure_interface_profile() {
    case "$SELECTED_INTERFACE" in
        tun0|tap0)
            # VPN interface - can be more aggressive
            echo "VPN detected - enabling aggressive timing"
            TIMING="-T5"
            ;;
        wlan0*)
            # Wireless - be conservative (may drop packets)
            echo "Wireless detected - conservative timing"
            TIMING="-T3"
            ;;
        eth0|ens*)
            # Wired - optimal performance
            echo "Wired detected - balanced timing"
            TIMING="-T4"
            ;;
    esac
}
```

This automatically adjusts scan behavior based on the interface type!

    local response=$(curl -s "https://api.shodan.io/shodan/host/${target}?key=${api_key}")
    
    # Parse JSON (requires jq)
    echo "$response" | jq -r '.data[] | "\(.port): \(.product) \(.version)"'
}

# Integrate into workflow
configure_target() {
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # Add Shodan check
    if [ -n "$SHODAN_API_KEY" ]; then
        search_shodan "$TARGET"
    fi
}
```

## Interface Detection: A Deep Dive

### Why This Matters More Than You Think

When I first started pentesting, I made a critical mistake: I assumed nmap would "just figure out" which interface to use. During an external assessment, I was connected to the client's VPN (tun0) but also had my home WiFi active (wlan0). 

**I ran nmap without specifying an interface.**

Nmap used my default route—which was my home WiFi. The client's IDS saw scans coming from an IP that wasn't the authorized VPN connection. The SOC team called the CISO. The CISO called my boss. My boss called me. Not fun.

**The lesson:** Always know which interface your traffic is using.

### The Technical Why

Network interfaces are like doors in a house. You might have:
- **Front door (eth0):** Main entrance, everyone sees you
- **Back door (wlan0):** Alternate route, different network  
- **Secret tunnel (tun0):** Hidden path (VPN)

When you scan without specifying, you're basically saying "use whichever door is most convenient." That's rarely what you want in security work.

### Real-World Scenarios Where This Saved Me

**Scenario 1: The Double-NAT Trap**
```
Situation: Client had double-NAT setup (router behind router)
Problem: Scanning from eth0 hit outer NAT, missed internal devices
Solution: Switched to secondary interface on internal subnet
Result: Found 15 additional devices that "didn't exist" before
```

**Scenario 2: The Wireless Pivot**
```
Situation: Needed to test from employee perspective
Setup: Laptop had eth0 (wired) and wlan0 (guest WiFi)
Test 1: Scan from eth0 - showed internal resources (expected)
Test 2: Scan from wlan0 - ALSO showed internal resources (bad!)
Result: Guest WiFi had no segmentation - critical finding
```

**Scenario 3: The VPN Fail-Open**
```
Situation: Testing VPN security
Setup: Connected to client VPN (tun0)
Test: Deliberately killed VPN mid-scan
Result: Traffic failed over to wlan0 automatically
Impact: Real IP exposed, scan continued from wrong source
Lesson: Framework now detects interface drops
```

### How to Test Your Setup

**Test 1: Verify Interface Routing**
```bash
# Select interface in framework: tun0
# Before scanning, verify routing:
ip route get 8.8.8.8

# Should show:
# 8.8.8.8 via X.X.X.X dev tun0 src Y.Y.Y.Y

# If it shows different interface, FIX IT FIRST
```

**Test 2: Confirm Source IP**
```bash
# What IP will the target see?

# Method 1: tcpdump on target
sudo tcpdump -i any src <your_expected_ip>

# Method 2: Quick web test
curl ifconfig.me
# Should match your expected source IP
```

**Test 3: Interface Persistence**
```bash
# Start scan, then check if interface changes

# Terminal 1: Run framework scan
./sampleframework.sh

# Terminal 2: Monitor routing
watch -n 1 "ip route | grep default"

# If default route changes during scan = problem!
```

## Philosophy: Why Customize?

The best security tools aren't the ones with the most features—they're the ones that match YOUR workflow and thinking style.

When I started, I copied commands from tutorials verbatim. I was slow and didn't understand what I was doing. The breakthrough came when I started modifying tools to fit how MY brain works.

Some people like verbose output. I prefer minimal, actionable data. Some like manual control. I prefer automation with decision points. Neither is wrong—they're different.

That's why I'm giving you these scripts with the expectation that you'll CHANGE them. I don't want you running scan09 forever. I want you to:

1. Understand how it works
2. Identify what doesn't fit your style  
3. Modify it
4. Break it
5. Fix it
6. Learn from the process

Every time you change something, you have to understand what that code does. You'll break things. You'll fix them. You'll discover edge cases. **That's learning.**

## Real-World Usage Examples

### Scenario 1: External Penetration Test

```bash
# Day 1: Initial reconnaissance
./sampleframework.sh

# Interface selection appears:
# SELECT: tun0 (VPN interface)
# This ensures you're coming from authorized IP

# Use "Ghost Mode" to avoid detection
# Let it run overnight

# Day 2: Web enumeration
./scan07  # Focuses on web services discovered
# Review results, identify attack surface

# Day 3: Exploitation
msfconsole -r s3rp_OP_*/metasploit_resources/auto_setup.rc
# Use the auto-generated resource file
```

### Scenario 2: Internal Network Assessment

```bash
# Physical presence on-site, connected via ethernet

./sampleframework.sh

# Interface selection:
# [1] eth0 (client network) ← SELECT THIS
# [2] wlan0 (your hotspot) ← DON'T USE THIS
# 
# SELECT: [1]

# Speed is OK on internal, no need for stealth
# Use "Quick Survey" mode
# Scan entire /24 network quickly

# Identify critical systems
# Use the HTML report to prioritize

# Deep dive on interesting hosts
./sampleframework.sh  # Use "Vulnerability Hunt" on specific IPs
```

### Scenario 3: Bug Bounty Hunting

```bash
# Target: example.com and subdomains
./scan07  # Web-only enumeration
# Use custom wordlist for tech stack

# If API endpoints found:
# Modify scan07 to use API-specific wordlists

# When interesting findings:
# Use scan04 Searchsploit integration to find exploits
```

### Scenario 4: Red Team Engagement

```bash
# Need maximum stealth over weeks
./scan04  # "Ghost Recon" with proxychains

# Interface selection critical:
# [1] eth0 - Direct connection (AVOID)
# [2] tun0 - VPN connection (USE THIS)
# [3] tun1 - Secondary VPN (BACKUP)
#
# SELECT: [2] tun0

# Spread scans over days
# Document everything
# Use unified framework's reporting

# Generate MSF resources for team
# Share the .rc file with team members
```

### Scenario 5: Wireless Security Assessment (NEW)

```bash
# Testing wireless network security
# You have multiple interfaces available

# Phase 1: Test from wired perspective
./sampleframework.sh
# SELECT: [1] eth0 (wired connection)
# Document what's accessible from wired

# Phase 2: Test from guest WiFi
./sampleframework.sh
# SELECT: [2] wlan0 (guest WiFi)  
# Should see LESS than wired (if properly segmented)

# Phase 3: Test from employee WiFi
# Connect to employee SSID (if authorized)
./sampleframework.sh
# SELECT: [2] wlan0 (employee WiFi)
# Compare access levels

# Findings: Guest WiFi accessing internal resources = CRITICAL
```

### Scenario 6: Multi-Perspective Reconnaissance (NEW)

```bash
# Advanced technique: Scan from multiple perspectives

# Create multiple sessions
SESSION_1="External perspective (Internet)"
SESSION_2="VPN perspective (Remote access)"
SESSION_3="Internal perspective (Physical)"

# Session 1: Public IP
./sampleframework.sh
# SELECT: [S] Skip (use default internet interface)
# PROFILE: Quick Survey
# Save results

# Session 2: VPN
./sampleframework.sh  
# SELECT: tun0 (VPN)
# PROFILE: Balanced Recon
# Save results

# Session 3: On-site
./sampleframework.sh
# SELECT: eth0 (wired)
# PROFILE: Total Infrastructure
# Save results

# Compare all three reports
# Find differences in accessibility
# Map network segmentation
```

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Running Too Fast
**Problem:** `-T5` timing triggers IDS  
**Solution:** Use `-T2` or `-T3` for production networks  
**Learn:** Speed vs stealth is always a trade-off

### Pitfall 2: Too Many Decoys
**Problem:** `-D RND:50` looks suspicious  
**Solution:** Use 3-10 decoys maximum  
**Learn:** Realistic traffic patterns matter

### Pitfall 3: Wrong Wordlist
**Problem:** Using `common.txt` on a massive site  
**Solution:** Choose wordlist based on time budget  
**Learn:** `common.txt` = quick, `directory-list-2.3-medium.txt` = thorough

### Pitfall 4: Ignoring Failed Proxies
**Problem:** ProxyChains config broken, but script runs anyway  
**Solution:** The unified framework checks proxy health  
**Learn:** Always verify your anonymity layer

### Pitfall 5: Not Saving Session Data
**Problem:** Lost terminal, lost all results  
**Solution:** All scripts save to organized directories  
**Learn:** Session management is critical

## Final Thoughts

This toolkit represents hundreds of hours of learning, experimentation, and real-world application. I'm sharing it not because it's perfect—it's not—but because I wish someone had shared something like this with me when I was starting.

The security field is intimidating when you're new. Everyone seems to know things you don't. Everyone has custom tools that seem like magic. But here's the secret: **we all started from zero.** We all copied and modified other people's work until we understood it well enough to create our own.

This is my contribution to that cycle of learning and sharing.

Take this code, break it, fix it, improve it, and make it yours. And then, when you've learned something valuable, share it with the next person coming up behind you.

That's how we all get better.

**Stay curious. Stay ethical. Happy hacking.**
